# AiGuseeConsole
 AI interface that guesses 4 digits that the user has selected in a certain order with maximum efficiency.
 
 ## How to use 
 Think of a 4-digit number whose digits are between 1 and 6
 The computer will try to guess each time what the number is. After each guess you need to enter input how many digits the computer guesses are in the correct position relative to   your number and how many digits the computer guesses are in your number but not in the correct position
 
 # Example
 Suppose we chose the number 3245.
